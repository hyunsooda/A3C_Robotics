# Design and Implementation of A3C Algorithm for Self-Driving in ROS Platform


<ul>
  <li> Refer to ROBOTIS e-Manual(chapter 14. machine-learning) for needed dependencies </li>
  <li> There are launch files (turtlebot3_a3c_global.launch, turtlebot3_a3c_local1.launch, turtlebot3_a3c_local2.launch) </li>
  <li> You can add more launch file to learn or simulate using many nodes(local network threads) </li>
  <li> </li>
</ul>



## This project is opensource-extended version
- Forked from (https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_machine_learning)

## What tasks I did on origin project.
- Caught a bug
- Enhanced environment algorithm 
- Change learning model algorithm from DQN to A3C
